/*
 * Example configuration file for Services. After making the appropriate
 * changes to this file, place it in the Services data directory (as
 * specified in the "configure" script, default /home/username/services/data)
 * under the name "services.conf".
 *
 * The format of this file is fairly simple: three types of comments are supported:
 *  - All text after a '#' on a line is ignored, as in shell scripting
 *  - All text after '//' on a line is ignored, as in C++
 *  - A block of text like this one is ignored, as in C
 *
 * Outside of comments, there are three structures: blocks, keys, and values.
 *
 * A block is a named container, which contains a number of key to value pairs
 * - you may think of this as an array.
 *
 * A block is created like so:
 * foobar
 * {
 *    moo = "cow"
 *    foo = bar
 * }
 *
 * Keys are case insensitive. Values depend on what key - generally, information is
 * given in the key comment. The quoting of values (and most other syntax) is quite
 * flexible, however, please do not forget to quote your strings:
 *
 *   "This is a parameter string with spaces in it"
 *
 * If you need to include a double quote inside a quoted string, precede it
 * by a backslash:
 *
 *   "This string has \"double quotes\" in it"
 *
 * Time parameters can be specified either as an integer representing a
 * number of seconds (e.g. "3600" = 1 hour), or as an integer with a unit
 * specifier: "s" = seconds, "m" = minutes, "h" = hours, "d" = days.
 * Combinations (such as "1h30m") are not permitted. Examples (all of which
 * represent the same length of time, one day):
 *
 *   "86400", "86400s", "1440m", "24h", "1d"
 *
 * CAUTION:
 * Please note that your services might _CRASH_ if you add more format-
 * strings (%s, %d, etc.) to custom messages than Anope needs. Use the
 * default messages to see how many format-strings are needed.
 *
 * In the documentation for each directive, one of the following will be
 * included to indicate whether an option is required:
 *
 * [REQUIRED]
 *     Indicates a directive which must be given. Without it, Services will
 *     not start.
 *
 * [RECOMMENDED]
 *     Indicates a directive which may be omitted, but omitting it may cause
 *     undesirable side effects.
 *
 * [OPTIONAL]
 *     Indicates a directive which is optional. If not given, the feature
 *     will typically be disabled. If this is not the case, more
 *     information will be given in the documentation.
 *
 * [DISCOURAGED]
 *     Indicates a directive which may cause undesirable side effects if
 *     specified.
 *
 * [DEPRECATED]
 *     Indicates a directive which will disappear in a future version of
 *     Services, usually because its functionality has been either
 *     superseded by that of other directives or incorporated into the main
 *     program.

	 *
	 * NOTE: enc_sha1 relies on how the OS stores 2+ byte data internally, and is
	 * potentially broken when moving between 2 different OSes, such as moving from
	 * Linux to Windows. It is recommended that you use enc_sha256 instead if you want

	 * that you first try to get everyone's passwords converted to enc_sha256 before
	 * switching OSes by placing enc_sha256 at the beginning of the list.
