Anope Mutli Language Support
----------------------------

1) Adding a new language
2) Using languages with modules

1) Adding a new language

    Anope uses gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) to translate messages for users. To add a new language
    install gettext and run `msginit -l language -o anope.language.po -i anope.pot`. For example if I was translating to
    Spanish I could run `msginit -l es_ES -o anope.es_ES.po -i anope.pot`. Open the newly generating .po file in a good
    editor, there many pot file editors available, and start translating. Once you are done simply rerun ./Config;
    make && make install and add the language to your services.conf.

    If you did a language file translation and you want others to use it, please send it to team@anope.org (don't forget
    to mention clearly your (nick)name, your e-mail and the language name). You'll of course get full credit for it.

2) Using langages with modules

    Module authors can easially add the ability to have their modules translated by adding _() around the strings they
    need translated (messages to the user, etc). See a few of the modules in /modules/extras (cs_appendtopic, hs_request)
    for examples of this. If you want to translate a module someone has made, first generate a .pot file if there is none.
    Run `xgettext -s -d modulename -o modulename.pot --from-code=utf-8 modulename.cpp`. Then, run msginit on the .pot file
    with `msginit -l language -o modulename.language.po -i modulename.pot`. Translate the new .po file, then place it in
    the lang folder and rerun ./Config; make && make install.
