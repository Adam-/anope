1.9.3
-----
[x] Add in a subcommand system, ns_set, cs_set, etc.
[x] Threading
  [x] Mail sending needs to be threaded
[x] process_numlist needs to die
[x] SList needs to die
[x] SSL
[x] Command handling system needs to die, strtok() needs to die more
[ ] Asynchronous DNS
[ ] CIDR Akills, session exceptions, etc
[x] Hashing system for storing just about everything needs to die
[x] Add support for +k, +q, etc type umodes
[ ] Language system is disgusting, it must die.
  [ ] Modules should also have a way to add strings programatically
  [ ] Should be able to add many strings by dropping a file in a set location.
[+] Method to store listmodes (more generically than AKICK, too) for e.g. +beI and extbans, etc.
[x] Config bailing on /os reload needs to be non fatal
[ ] AutoID needs to be able to live through /os restart, current system is just annoying.
[ ] SQL tables need to changed to have references etc
[ ] MS IGNORE. Make it take nick (accounts) or n!u@h masks. Fake success of memo send still, but send to opers?
[ ] NS IDENTIFY changes
  [?] Last failed identify? Maybe more useful for sopers only, so users don't get unnecessarily worried
  [?] Last successful login time/ip? perhaps both of these should be a new nick setting
[ ] NS INFO: seperate field for last seen realhost, shown to SRA only
[ ] NS SUSPEND: show suspender and reason, probably to sopers only (see CS SUSPEND)
[x] Merge NS INFO blah ALL with NS INFO blah, if you're requesting info, you really want the info anyway.
[ ] Allow channel founders to change the fantasy trigger for their channel.

Future
------
[ ] Move a (lot) of stuff to class members as a defined interface rather than copypasta everywhere (ns_set, ns_saset!)
[?] Remote identification (1.9.1? will this break stuff?)
[ ] Language charset stuff, including collation (1.9.1? phoenix?)
[ ] fantasy: allow replies/notifications to fantasy commands to go to the channel via notice
[?] a way for a module to queue itself (or even another module) for unloading
[ ] Useful/common "third party" modules to core distro
  [ ] NS AJOIN
[?] Don't allow soper accounts to expire
[?] Reason for CS SET RESTRICTED
[x] AKILL/SGLINE/etc..
  [x] Setter
  [x] Time added
  [+] Time modified (can they be modified?)
  [ ] Time until expiry/expiry time (YES, time until expiry *instead of* expiry time, more human)
  [x] Reason
  [ ] Unique IDs on each AKILL/blah so that networks may use them as ticket IDs
[ ] HS ACTIVATE -ALL (rob sez this all needs reviewing)
[?] NS MARK, CS MARK. Allow multiple marks. Combine into OS MARK? (AKA os_info)
[?] More "friendly" date displays of some things like registration time ("November 7th 2006 (2 years, 0 months, 0 days ago)")
[?] OS INJECT
[?] Drop CS SET ENTRYMSG, replace with a 'news' type system? (limited to a configured number of items, default 3)
