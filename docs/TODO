1.9.4
-----
[x] MS IGNORE. Make it take nick (accounts) or n!u@h masks. Fake success of memo send still, but send to opers?
[x] Allow users to delete their own access
[x] ChanServ CLONE command
[x] XMLRPC to execute commands and get data from Anope
[+] fantasy: allow replies/notifications to fantasy commands to go to the channel via notice
[x] Method to store listmodes (more generically than AKICK, too) for e.g. +beI and extbans, etc.
[ ] understanding extbans for /cs unban etc.
[ ] (optional?) A way to confirm email changes by users
[ ] Auto identify through SSL key
[ ] Optional os_login system that can also use SSL keys.
[ ] os_info module to show useful configuration settings to services opers.
[ ] Remove nick requests. Instead use an unconfirmed nick group which cant recieve umode +r and auto expires after 1d?
[ ] LDAP

Future
------
[ ] NS IDENTIFY changes
  [?] Last failed identify? Maybe more useful for sopers only, so users don't get unnecessarily worried
  [?] Last successful login time/ip? perhaps both of these should be a new nick setting
[ ] NS INFO: seperate field for last seen realhost, shown to SRA only
[ ] NS SUSPEND: show suspender and reason, probably to sopers only (see CS SUSPEND)
[ ] Allow channel founders to change the fantasy trigger for their channel.
[ ] CIDR Akills, session exceptions, etc
[?] Language charset stuff, including collation (1.9.1? phoenix?)
[?] a way for a module to queue itself (or even another module) for unloading
[ ] Useful/common "third party" modules to core distro
  [ ] NS AJOIN
  [x] CS ENTRYMSG
[?] Don't allow soper accounts to expire
[?] Reason for CS SET RESTRICTED
[x] AKILL/SGLINE/etc..
  [x] Setter
  [x] Time added
  [+] Time modified (can they be modified?)
  [x] Time until expiry/expiry time (YES, time until expiry *instead of* expiry time, more human)
  [x] Reason
  [ ] Unique IDs on each AKILL/blah so that networks may use them as ticket IDs
[ ] HS ACTIVATE -ALL (rob sez this all needs reviewing)
