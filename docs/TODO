1.9.4
-----
[x] MS IGNORE. Make it take nick (accounts) or n!u@h masks. Fake success of memo send still, but send to opers?
[x] Allow users to delete their own access
[x] ChanServ CLONE command
[x] XMLRPC to execute commands and get data from Anope
[+] fantasy: allow replies/notifications to fantasy commands to go to the channel via notice

Future
------
[+] Method to store listmodes (more generically than AKICK, too) for e.g. +beI and extbans, etc.
[ ] NS IDENTIFY changes
  [?] Last failed identify? Maybe more useful for sopers only, so users don't get unnecessarily worried
  [?] Last successful login time/ip? perhaps both of these should be a new nick setting
[ ] NS INFO: seperate field for last seen realhost, shown to SRA only
[ ] NS SUSPEND: show suspender and reason, probably to sopers only (see CS SUSPEND)
[ ] Allow channel founders to change the fantasy trigger for their channel.
[ ] CIDR Akills, session exceptions, etc
[?] Language charset stuff, including collation (1.9.1? phoenix?)
[?] a way for a module to queue itself (or even another module) for unloading
[ ] Useful/common "third party" modules to core distro
  [ ] NS AJOIN
  [ ] CS ENTRYMSG
[?] Don't allow soper accounts to expire
[?] Reason for CS SET RESTRICTED
[x] AKILL/SGLINE/etc..
  [x] Setter
  [x] Time added
  [+] Time modified (can they be modified?)
  [x] Time until expiry/expiry time (YES, time until expiry *instead of* expiry time, more human)
  [x] Reason
  [ ] Unique IDs on each AKILL/blah so that networks may use them as ticket IDs
[ ] HS ACTIVATE -ALL (rob sez this all needs reviewing)
[?] Drop CS SET ENTRYMSG, replace with a 'news' type system? (limited to a configured number of items, default 3)
