Reported Bugs from Bugzilla: http://bugs.anope.org/
---------------------------------------------------

.- Strange Segfault on expiring nicknames. Almost arbitrary, very hard
   to reproduce.

.- Clone detection can give false warnings if a user connects and then 
   signs off several times in rapid succession. Clone detection also 
   goes off wrongly if a server links and has a number of clients from 
   the same hostname.

.- If there is absolutely no activity on your network, Services may delay
   timed events (nick kills, database saving, etc.) until the next message
   comes in from Services' uplink server.

.- Due to the usage of execve() once we SIGHUP from the shell, we can only
   do it once, after that execve() resets our signals.
