Anope Version 1.9.0
--------------------
F Modified compile to use g++
F Improve protocol modules support (classes, virtual methods, etc)
F Move core services to use BotInfo
F Move BotInfo and related methods into a class
F Move modules into a class
F Fixed ns resending of passcode issue
F Modules now delete themselves
F additional field where users' masked host can be stored so both masked IP and vhost are available instead of just one.
F No struct Uid, ugly, and, unnecessary that we store UID in BotInfo.
F Prevent deletion of core services via /bs bot
F Module subsystem cleanup ('modules' branch)
F Move modules to use classes somewhat (AnopeInit, AnopeFini)
F Change MODULE_INIT to return a pointer
F Remove duplicate module creation.. have loadModule return a pointer rather than creating one
F Remove buffered loading/unloading, this makes os_modunload perm, but who cares
F Remove 'delayed' loading, this is necessary because of before/after connected to ircd (ircd is before, rest after), I'm sure this can be done better.
A Remove old config, replace with insp-inspired (albeit bind format) config (CBX)
F Clean up protocol modules a bit
A InspIRCd 1.2 support
F Remove old (prior to 1.8.0) db compat
F Establish a proper base for services pseudoclients
F Add ss_main StatServ Hal9000 to play with :)
F Burn automake with fire (CBX)
