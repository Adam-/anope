Anope SMTP Client
-----------------

	- Provided with Anope is a simple SMTP client which can be used to replace programs like
SendMail in some cases. 

	- To use the SMTP client find the line in your services.conf for the "SendMailPath", enter
the path to your services installation directory, followed by the "anopesmtp" and the IP address
of a valid SMTP server. It should look something like

SendMailPath "/home/usersname/services/anopesmtp 194.97.50.135"

	- If you run into a problem you can compile a debug into the code by opening smtp.h and at the
bottom you should find "smtp_debug" change the 0 to a 1 and recompile the code. This should
generate a log file of what happened when it attempted to connect to the SMTP server.

Anope DB-Merger
---------------

	- This program tries to merge two standard anope-1.7.7+ database sets (chanserv, nickserv, botserv
and memoserv).

	- Put the two db sets in the folder where db-merger is located. The first db set must be in the form
<name>1.db, e.g. nick1.db or hosts1.db, the second set must be in the form <name>2.db, e.g. nick2.db or
chan2.db. Then execute the merger and follow the instructions.

Epona to Anope DB Converter
---------------------------

	- This program tries to convert epona-1.4.15+ dbs to anope standard dbs. At the moment this only
affects chanserv databases.

	- Put your epona (chanserv) database in the folder where the epona2anope file is located. Rename this
db file to chan1.db and run epona2anope, which will create a chan.db file. This new file is anope compatible.
