Anope SMTP Client

	- Provided with Anope is a simple SMTP client which can be used to replace programs like
SendMail in some cases. 

	- To use the SMTP client find the line in your services.conf for the "SendMailPath", enter
the path to your services installation directory, followed by the "anopesmtp" and the IP address
of a valid SMTP server. It should look something like

SendMailPath "/home/usersname/services/anopesmtp 194.97.50.135"

	- If you run into a problem you can compile a debug into the code by opening smtp.h and at the
bottom you should find "smtp_debug" change the 0 to a 1 and recompile the code. This should
generate a log file of what happened when it attempted to connect to the SMTP server.
