# UserKey1|2|3 <value> [REQUIRED]
#     
#     These keys are required to initiate the random number generator. These
#     numbers MUST be random as you want your passcodes to be random. Don't
#     give these keys to no anyone! Keep them private!
#     For those pple who don't understand what to do here: Just pick three
#     _different_ _random_ numbers with about 6 or 7 digits and put them here.
#     If the keys don't work, they might be too long or you forgot to remove
#     the # in front of them. Example:
#     UserKey1 9866235

#     UserKey2 <your_second_random_number_here>
#     UserKey3 <you_third_random_number_here>

# Proxy detection
#
###########################################################################

# Note: if ProxyDetect is not set, all parameters after it in this section
# are optional.

# ProxyDetect [OPTIONAL]
#
# Enables insecure proxy detection. Services will automatically
# scan each incoming user and akill those that use insecure proxy.
#
# Anope currently supports detection of Wingate (port 23), SOCKS4/5
# (port 1080), and HTTP proxy (ports 3128 and 8080). It uses the
# protocol of each proxy type to connect to an IRC server, it does
# not only check if the port is open (so your users may still have
# an open telnet server on their port 23 for example).
#
# WARNING: You should get the authorization of the administrator of
# the computer which runs the proxy detector before enabling it; not
# all administrators will accept it. Also note that in certain
# countries, port scanning is prohibited.
#
# This feature requires threading support to be compiled into Anope.

#ProxyDetect

# ProxyThreads <number> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the number of threads Services will launch when starting. Each
# thread will have the responsibility to scan queued hostname for
# proxies.
#
# This value must be set depending of the number of users you have
# on your network. The more threads are used, the more simultaneous
# checks can be done. Remember however, that threads are
# resource-consuming.
#
# WARNING: On Linux, each thread takes a background process, and there
# is an additional process used for thread management; this is a problem
# if you are limited in the number of background process you can use
# (on a paid shell for example).

ProxyThreads 5

# ProxyMessage... <message> [RECOMMENDED]
#
# Sets the notices that will be sent out to users before Services
# scan them for proxy. You may not use all of them, but just as much as
# necessary.

ProxyMessage1 "I will now detect if you're using an insecure proxy."
ProxyMessage2 "If you see a connection on port 23, 1080, 3128 or 8080 from"
ProxyMessage3 "my.box.net, please disregard it, as it is the detector in action."
ProxyMessage4 "See http://proxy.myirc.net/ for information about our proxy policy."
#ProxyMessage5 "Enter"
#ProxyMessage6 "whatever"
#ProxyMessage7 "you want"
#ProxyMessage8 "here."

# ProxyCheck... [OPTIONAL]
#
# Determines what types of proxy Anope will try to find (respectively
# Wingate on port 23, SOCKS4 on port 1080, SOCKS5 on port 1080, HTTP
# proxy on port 3128, HTTP proxy on port 8080 and HTTP proxy on port
# 80).

# ProxyTimeout <time> [REQUIRED]

# Sets the maximum length of time we allow a connect/read operation to
# take. If you set this value too high, your threads may hang on a single
# check for a very long time. The best is to try different values
# and see which one is the more efficient for your network.

ProxyTimeout 15s

# ProxyTestServer <ip> <port> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the *IP* and port of the IRC server to use as a target when
# testing users for proxy.

ProxyTestServer "1.2.3.4" 6667

# ProxyExpire <time> [RECOMMENDED]
#
# Sets the length of time before a proxy host cache entry expires, if
# not used. If this is not set the default time is 2 days.

ProxyExpire 30d

# ProxyCacheExpire <time> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the length of time before a normal host cache entry expires, if
# not used. This cannot be set to 0d.
#
# Every non-proxy hosts will be stored in cache (to avoid too many scans
# to the same host), so you should set this enough low to not fill your
# memory, especially on large networks.

ProxyCacheExpire 1d

# ProxyAkillReason <reason> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the reason that will be used to AKILL an user from the network
# if a proxy is detected.

ProxyAkillReason "You're using an insecure proxy. See http://proxy.myirc.net/config.html for information about how to config your proxy in a safe manner."

# WallProxy [OPTIONAL]
#
# Sends a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS when an user using an insecure proxy is being
# AKILLed.

WallProxy

# ProxyMax <number> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the maximum proxy cache entries that can be displayed in a single
# call to OperServ CACHE.

ProxyMax 50

** ADDED    CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# UseTS6  [OPTIONAL]
#
# Modern hybrid ircd like Ratbox 2.0.x support a protocol called TS6. 
# However this protocol is optional thus our default support is for without 
# TS6, if you want to take advantage of TS6, enable this option.

Anope Version 1.7.7
-------------------
** ADDED    CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# NSAddAccessOnReg  [OPTIONAL]
#
# When enabled, services will add the usermask of registering users to the
# access list of their newly created account. If you disable this, users
# will always have to identify to nickserv before being recognized, unless
# they manually add an address to the access list of their account.

NSAddAccessOnReg

# UlineServers  [OPTIONAL]
#
# A list of ulined servers on your network, these servers are assumed they
# can set channel modes and we will not attempt to take them from them
# WARNING: do not put your user servers in this option

UlineServers "stats.your.network, proxy.your.network"

# KillOnSGline [OPTIONAL]
#
# When enabled, this option makes the services send an (SVS)KILL command
# immediately after SGLINE ADD. This eliminates the need of killing the 
# users after the SGLINE has been added.

# KillOnSGline

# KillOnSQline [OPTIONAL]
#
# When enabled, this option makes the services send an (SVS)KILL command
# immediately after SQLINE ADD. This eliminates the need of killing the 
# users after the SQLINE has been added.

# NetworkDomain <name> [OPTIONAL]
#
#     If your network has a common domain name, specify it there (for
#     example, all IRCZONE servers have a name ending in ".irczone.cl",
#     so "irczone.cl" would be set there.
#
#     You can specify more than one Network Domain by separating each one by
#     a space: NetworkDomain "localnet.net localnet.com"
#
#     Note that this directive is no longer used by the GLOBAL command, since
#     it uses a dynamic list of connected servers regardless of their
#     domains. However, some modules may still use this value, so you might
#     want to keep it just in case.

NetworkDomain "localnet.com"

# ListOpersOnly  [DEPRECATED]
#     When enabled, limits use of the ChanServ and NickServ LIST commands
#     to IRC operators.
#
#     This directive has been superseded by the NSListOpersOnly and
#     CSListOpersOnly directives.

# RestrictOperNick [OPTIONAL]
#     Forbids the registration of nicks that contain nick with services        
#     access. So if Tester is a Services Oper, for example, You can't 
#     register NewTester or Tester123 unless you are an IRC operator.
#RestrictOperNicks

# UseTokens [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows irc networks to use TOKEN commands instead of the 
#     standard commands. This saves bandwidth but can break older
#     modules that are not set to trap for TOKEN - if you are using
#     older modules do NOT use this option
#UseTokens

# UseSVS2MODE [OPTIONAL]
#     On Unreal IRCD use SVS2MODE instead of SVSMODE, doing this will
#     show services changing user modes.
#UseSVS2MODE

# NewsCount [OPTIONAL]
#     The number of LOGON/OPER News item to display when a user logs
#     on. The default value is 3
#NewsCount 3

# Numeric [OPTIONAL]
#     Many ircd identify themselves with a Numeric when using this option
#     consult your ircds documentation before using this
#Numeric 0

# UnRestrictSAdmin [OPTIONAL]
#     On many ircd Anope removes the umode of +a from users whom are not
#     Service Admin in Anope. This mode is NOT used by Anope for any form
#     of access. Thus this option allows them to keep the mode without having
#     to be a Service Admin in Anope

# UseSVSHOLD [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows Bahamut-networks to use SVSHOLD instead of the services
#     enforcer. This option has been introduced in Bahamut 1.4.35 and
#     places a temporary Q:Line instead of introducing a new nick,
#     which is better for both CPU and bandwidth. If you enable this
#     option on a pre-1.4.35 Bahamut, it is most likely to break.
