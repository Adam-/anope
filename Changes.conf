Anope Version 1.7.6
-------------------
** ADDED    CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# UserKey1|2|3 <value> [REQUIRED]
#     
#     These keys are required to initiate the random number generator. These
#     numbers MUST be random as you want your passcodes to be random. Don't
#     give these keys to no anyone! Keep them private!

#UserKey1 9866235
#UserKey2 5216332
#UserKey3 9651291


# RestrictOperNick [OPTIONAL]
#     Forbids the registration of nicks that contain nick with services        
#     access. So if Tester is a Services Oper, for example, You can't 
#     register NewTester or Tester123 unless you are an IRC operator.
#RestrictOperNicks

# UseTokens [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows irc networks to use TOKEN commands instead of the 
#     standard commands. This saves bandwidth but can break older
#     modules that are not set to trap for TOKEN - if you are using
#     older modules do NOT use this option
#UseTokens

# UseSVS2MODE [OPTIONAL]
#     On Unreal IRCD use SVS2MODE instead of SVSMODE, doing this will
#     show services changing user modes.
#UseSVS2MODE

# NewsCount [OPTIONAL]
#     The number of LOGON/OPER News item to display when a user logs
#     on. The default value is 3
#NewsCount 3

# Numeric [OPTIONAL]
#     Many ircd identify themselves with a Numeric when using this option
#     consult your ircds documentation before using this
#Numeric 0

# UnRestrictSAdmin [OPTIONAL]
#     On many ircd Anope removes the umode of +a from users whom are not
#     Service Admin in Anope. This mode is NOT used by Anope for any form
#     of access. Thus this option allows them to keep the mode without having
#     to be a Service Admin in Anope
#UnRestrictSAdmin

Anope Version 1.7.5
-------------------
** ADDED    CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# UseSVSHOLD [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows Bahamut-networks to use SVSHOLD instead of the services
#     enforcer. This option has been introduced in Bahamut 1.4.35 and
#     places a temporary Q:Line instead of introducing a new nick,
#     which is better for both CPU and bandwidth. If you enable this
#     option on a pre-1.4.35 Bahamut, it is most likely to break.
#UseSVSHOLD

** MODIFIED CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# NetworkDomain <name> [OPTIONAL]
#
#     If your network has a common domain name, specify it there (for
#     example, all IRCZONE servers have a name ending in ".irczone.cl",
#     so "irczone.cl" would be set there.
#
#     You can specify more than one Network Domain by separating each one by
#     a space: NetworkDomain "localnet.net localnet.com"
#
#     Note that this directive is no longer used by the GLOBAL command, since
#     it uses a dynamic list of connected servers regardless of their
#     domains. However, some modules may still use this value, so you might
#     want to keep it just in case.

NetworkDomain "localnet.com"
