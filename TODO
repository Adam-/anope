VIPER'S CHRISTMAS LIST
----------------------

[ ] way for one module to depend on another... not like 2 MOD_HEADs and it being unpredictable which is loaded first..
	the MOD_HEAD MOD_TAIL allows for too few combinations (interface code of insp, hooks code of insp?)
[ ] A way for one module to interact with another.. moduleGetData() only works for current module..
	moduleGetData() needs to die in a fire.

	We should replace this with proper inheritance of a class MetadataObject, which allows Shrink(), Extend(), GetExt().
	We may also wish to add additional methods for laziness (ShrinkString(), ExtendString(), GetExt()), as most of the use
	of metadata is strings, but not all.

	This also allows modules to tie whatever data they want onto any object.

[ ] generic database routines modules can use to create their own database
[ ] generic way to check which modes a user has set (u->HasUmode(UMODE_OPER))
? [ ] a way for a module to queue itself (or even another module) for unloading
[x] additional field where users' masked host can be stored so both masked IP and vhost are available instead of just one.


w00t's CHRISTMAS LIST
---------------------

[x] no struct Uid bollocks. that's insane, and now, unnecessary that we store UID in BotInfo.
[ ] Move AnopeInit and AnopeFini(?) into a derived module class, change MODULE_INIT to return a pointer.
[ ] Move a (lot) of stuff to class members as a defined interface rather than copypasta everywhere (ns_set, ns_saset!)
[x] prevent deletion of core services via /bs bot
[ ] Redo database insanity.
[ ] burn do_sjoin with fire
? [ ] burn automake with fire

anopeng-uid branch TODO
-----------------------

[ ] add overridden form of SendGlobops accepting BotInfo
[ ] SendAkill should just take a pointer to the Akill class instead of millions of fields (same for some other stuff)
[ ] chan_set_modes should take BotInfo, possibly with override for User *?
[ ] SendClientIntroduction should take a UID param, rather than generating one(?)


anopeng-config branch TODO
--------------------------

[+] remove old config, replace with insp-inspired (albeit bind format) config (CBX)
